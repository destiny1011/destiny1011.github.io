       Taking place in February 14, 2018  in Parkland, Florida, Nikolas Cruz decided to take the lives of some of the kids at his school. Stoneman Douglas High School was the last place 17 kids stepped foot into. Nikolas Cruz, 19, walked into Stoneman Douglas High School in the afternoon with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle and began gunfire. Police quickly arrived to the scene and evacuated the building. Hundreds of students walked out in terror of losing their lives. No lives lost yet Nikolas moved on to another part of the school building. Nikolas walked out along with the other students running. Nikolas was reported leaving the school trying to fit in and then went to another part of the school. However police knew who he was due to previous claims by their students. The police were warned as he entered the second building. Five minutes after walking into the building Nikolas shot 17 people and they instantly died. Police stated “The gunman walked purposefully, and nothing stopped him”. Ditching the bag with the weapons in it, Nikolas resumed to work out of the building and no one stopped him. Dressed in the school uniform, he was unnoticed. He got into his car and went to the nearest Walmart to then buy a drink at the Subway within it. After that drink he went to McDonald’s and then strolled around the neighborhood without a care. A police officer drove by and identified his clothing. The officer told him to stop. Nikolas did not hesitate, he laid down and allowed the police officer to arrest him.
